# Healthcare Backend API

## Overview
This project is a backend system for a healthcare application built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **PostgreSQL**. It allows users to register, log in, and manage patient and doctor records securely with JWT authentication.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Sequelize ORM**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **dotenv** for environment management

## Database Schema Explanation

### User Table
The **User** table stores user information, including their name, email, and password. Each user has a unique email and an automatically generated ID.

### Patient Table
The **Patient** table contains records of patients, including their name, age, and disease. Each patient is linked to a user, meaning only the user who created a patient can manage their records.

### Doctor Table
The **Doctor** table keeps details about doctors, including their name, age, and medical specialty.

### Patient-Doctor Mapping Table
The **Patient-Doctor Mapping** table establishes a many-to-many relationship between patients and doctors. It records which doctors are assigned to which patients, allowing multiple doctors to be linked to a single patient and vice versa.
